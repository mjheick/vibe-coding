The following conversation is what's relevant about this "game" concept:

> "Dude. It’s that time of the year where I come up with a genius idea for us to make millions to. And this one is brilliant."

> "Right. It’s a very basic mobile phone game. Basic graphics and controls. You’re on a road whether it be in a car, on a bike etc. you get to the end of the road and you have a choice to turn left or right. You can’t see where left or right takes you. The aim of the game is to take the turning that’s not a dead end or it’s game over. The longer you keep going the higher the points you get. So it’s a high score type of game where your scores are posted online in the game. That’s pretty much it. It should be a free game with ads or one of payment for no ads. Micro transactions like skins and other cosmetic stuff can be added too."

claude.ai: "Make me a very basic game, with simple graphics and controls. The concept is that you're at the end of a road and your only choices are to go left or right. You cannot see where left or right will take you, and it's a 50% chance that your turn will be a dead end and it's game over. Every successful choice gains you one point until you reach a dead end. Once the dead end has been reached the high score shows up and it's ordered by highest successful count of turns to lowest."

I responded: "I had AI give it a shot:"

> "I think I’ve realised my first mistake lol I should go for more favourable odds than 50/50. Maybe a 70% chance of making the right turn. If that’s even possible. Also, can we making it a moving game? Bit like outrun from back in the 80s. Not 3d coz I like the overhead 2d model looks like, but the road moves and you see your character moving. Be honest. Is this a crap idea?"
